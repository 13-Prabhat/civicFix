> Report issues around you with a photo and a location. Track fixes on a public map. Help authorities respond faster and better.

## üåü Inspiration
We asked a simple question: why do small problems around us never get fixed? Potholes, broken streetlights, and overflowing garbage affect daily life. Complaints get lost, people give up. CivicFix turns that frustration into action. Report an issue in seconds, then watch it move toward a solution in the open.

---

## üöÄ What it does
- Snap a photo of a local issue
- Location is auto tagged with Google Maps or MapmyIndia
- Issues appear on a public map for everyone
- People upvote issues that affect them
- The complaint is forwarded to the relevant municipal authority
- Reporters earn Civic Hero points when issues are resolved

Municipal bodies get a clean dashboard with reported vs resolved counts, response time, and issue hot spots.

## üì¶ Quick Start

### 1) Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/civicfix.git

```bash
# Firebase

## üìñ Project Story

### How we built it
We kept it mobile first. React handles UI, Firebase stores data and photos, maps handle geolocation. When an issue is marked resolved, Civic Hero points update in real time.

### Challenges
GPS accuracy in crowded areas, privacy vs transparency, and different municipal workflows. Building fast while staying simple was the hardest part.

### What we learned
Design for everyone, not only power users. Real civic problems are social and technical. Trust matters as much as code.

## üîÆ Roadmap
- Pilot with a mid sized Indian city
- Offline reporting with sync
- Anonymous mode
- AI that detects issue type from the photo
- Predictive dashboards for authorities
- Localization and rollout to more regions

---

## üë• Team
Built with care by **Binary Bros**. We believe small actions add up. CivicFix helps people take those actions.
